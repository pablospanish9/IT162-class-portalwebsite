 <h3>About me</h3>
 <p>Hello, my name is Pablo Sepulveda. I was born and 
  raised in Chile. I immigrated to the US when I was 18 years old. 
  I studied music and flute in college.
  Now I work independently as a Spanish interpreter, translator and voice-over 
  artist. I enjoy learning 
  about computers and technology. I also enjoy exercising and learning ASL language.</p>
<p>In 2020, most of my work disappeared because of the pandemic.
  While in lockdown, with entire days to fill at home, I decided to upgrade my skills, 
  and I studied computer
   technologies at North Seattle college, earning a Web Application
    Technologies Certificate. I am enthusiastic about learning more
 front-end web design and development.</p>
